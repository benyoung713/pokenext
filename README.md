## Welcome to the PokeNext app

This app gives users the opportunity to choose a Pokemon from the dropdown to see more information about them.
Choose a Pokemon from the dropdown and on the right hand side, you will see some information about them.
If you can't find the Pokemon you want in the initial dropdown, scroll to the bottom of the dropdown and select: "Load more..."
This will load more Pokemon into the menu.
